# Variable Declarations

#### 1. Explain the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` variable declarations in JavaScript. Identify how each of these variable types is scoped, as well as whether it can be reassigned to a new value within its scope. 
> Let: A variable can be reassigned but not redeclared within its scope. "let" is block scope. Const: A variable cannot be reassigned or redeclared within its scope. "const" is also block scope. Var: A variable can be both reassigned and redeclared in its own scope if you wish. "var" is function/local scope.
