## Favorite Drink

Use `console.log` to print out a string containing your favorite drink. You should only have to write a single line of code. There is no incorrect choice here, just incorrect code :)

```js
console.log("My favorite drink is water.");
```

## Grouping Operator
The author of this code is trying to print out the average of the numbers 13 and 23 but is missing parentheses. Add parentheses to the code so that the correct result will print out. 

```js
console.log((13 + 23) / 2);
```
