# Asking a Question

#### 1. Ask a great question about a JavaScript topic of your choice. It should be 1. specific, 2. clear and concise, and 3. show that you've put in work. 
> Maybe we haven't gotten reached this topic in the curriculum yet, but in Python there are dictionaries which store information using keys and values. Does Javascript have something similar? I like loops, which iterate through everything, but I want to specifically find something without having to iterate. How could I do this?
