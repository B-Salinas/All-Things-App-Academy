# The UNIQUE Constraint

#### 1. Explain why you would apply the `UNIQUE` constraint to a column in a table.
> The UNIQUE constraint specifies that one or more columns in a table can only contain unique values. Each use of the UNIQUE constraint must be different than other UNIQUE constraints, otherwise, it's just the same constraint. You might use a UNIQUE constraint on a column to avoid duplicates.
