# Sync vs. Async

#### 1. Describe the difference between asynchronous and synchronous code. Your response should provide one example of an asynchronous function in JavaScript. 
> Synchronous code is code where order of commands executed is guaranteed. Asynchronous code is the opposite -- order of commands executing is not guaranteed. Asynchronous code is used to evaluate unpredictable events, such as user input. "setTimeout()" is also another example of asynchronous code.
