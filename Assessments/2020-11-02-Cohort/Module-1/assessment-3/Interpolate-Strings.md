## Interpolate Strings

This problem is worth 1 problem. You may receive partial credit. 

Write a function `makeCake(str1, str2)` that takes in two strings representing ingredients as arguments. Use **string interpolation** to return a new string using both ingredients. See the examples for more information.

#### Solution 
```js
function makeCake(str1, str2) {
  return `I'm making a cake with ${str1} and ${str2}!`;
}
```
