#### 1. JavaScript uses an event loop model for execution. Describe what role the 'message queue' plays in the event loop. 
> The Event Loop is comprised of the Call Stack and the Message Queue. The Call Stack keeps track of functions that are being evaluated while the Message Queue keeps track of things that will be executed to the Call Stack, once the Call Stack is empty.
