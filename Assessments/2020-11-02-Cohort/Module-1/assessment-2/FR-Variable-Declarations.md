# Variable Declarations

#### 1. Explain the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` variable declarations in JavaScript. Identify how each of these variable types is scoped, as well as whether it can be reassigned to a new value within its scope. 
> CONST is block-scope and cannot be redeclared or reassigned within its scope. LET is block-scope and can be reassigned, but not redeclared, within its scope. VAR is local/function-scope and can be reassigned and redeclared within its scope.
