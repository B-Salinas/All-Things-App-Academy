Redux is a JavaScript Framework for managing the frontend state of a Web Application. It allows us to store information in an organized matter and to quickly retrieve that information from anywhere in a web app. 

**Advantages of Redux**:
- simplifies some of the more cumbersome aspects of Flux
- very lightweight, the library only takes up 2 kbs
- very fast, the time to insert or retrieve data is low
- predictable, interacting with the data store in the same way repeatedly will produce the same effect.
