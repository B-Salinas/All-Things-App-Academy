# Running JavaScript Locally

#### 1. Match the commands `ls`, `cd`, `pwd` to their descriptions
#### 2. Given a folder structure diagram, a list of `cd (path)` commands and target files, match the paths to the target files
#### 3. Use VSCode to create a folder. Within the folder, create a .js file containing `console.log("hello new world");` and save it
#### 4. Use node to execute a JavaScript file in the terminal

# Pair Programming

#### 1. Differentiate between the "Driver" and "Navigator" roles in a pair programming session
#### 2. Describe at least three benefits of effective pair programming
#### 3. Demonstrate empathetic communication and be able to explain the meaning of "You are not your code"
#### 4. Identify negative interactions during a pair programming session
#### 5. Identify the exact steps of a/A's pair programming process
#### 6. Describe the importance of pair programming competency while interviewing for jobs

# Plain Old JavaScript Objects (POJOs)

#### 1. Label variables as either Primitive vs Reference
#### 2. Identify when to use . vs [] when accessing values of an object
#### 3. Use the `obj[key] !== undefined` pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object
#### 4. Utilize `Object.keys` and `Object.values` in a function
#### 5. Iterate through an object using a `for ... in` loop
#### 6. Define a function that utilizes `...rest` syntax to accept an arbitrary number of arguments
#### 7. Use `...spread` syntax for Object literals and Array literals
#### 8. Destructure an array to reference specific elements
#### 9. Destructure an object to reference specific values
#### 10. Write a function that accepts an array as an argument and returns an object representing the count of each character in the array

# Callbacks

#### 1. Given multiple plausible reasons, identify why functions are called "First Class Objects" in JavaScript
#### 2. Given a code snippet containing an anonymous callback, a named callback, and multiple `console.log`s, predict what will be printed
#### 3. Write a function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should return the result of the callback that is greater
#### 4. Write a function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array.map()`
#### 5. Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array.filter()`
#### 6. Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array.every()`

# Scope

#### 1. Identify the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations
#### 2. Explain the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations
#### 3. Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes funciton scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining
#### 4. Define an arrow function
#### 5. Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope
