#### 1. Craft a clear, concise coding question to a more experienced developer
#### 2. Research unknown JavaScript code syntax using MDN
#### 3. Identify and fix a bug in code based on an error message
#### 4. Manage your time and stress at App Academy

# Expressions

#### 1. Given a working REPL interface, write and execute a statement that will print "hello world" using `console.log`
#### 2. Identify that strings are a list of characters defined by using double or single quotes
#### 3. Given an arithmetic expression using +, -, \*, /, %, compute its value
#### 4. Given an expression, predict if its value is NaN
#### 5. Construct the truth table tables for &&, ||, !
#### 6. Given an expression consisting of >, >=, ===, <, <=, compute it's value
#### 7. Apply De Morgan's Law to a boolean expression
#### 8. Given an expression that utilitizes operator precedence, compute its value
#### 9. Given an expression, use the groupling operator to change it's evaluation
#### 10. Given expressions using == and ===, compute their values
#### 11. Given a code snippet using postfix ++, postfix --, =+, -=, /=, \*=, predict the value of the labeled lines
#### Create and assign a variable using `let` to a string, integer, and a boolean. Read its value and print to the console

# Strings

#### 1. Describe the properties of a string
#### 2. Create a string
#### 3. Find the length of a string
#### 4. Find the character at a certain index in a string
#### 5. Concatenate two strings together
#### 6. Find the first instance of a character in a string
#### 7. Create a new string from a subsection of another string

# Intro to Functions

#### 1. Define a function using function declaration
#### 2. Define a function that calculates the average of two numbers, call it, pass in arguments, and print its return value
#### 3. Identify the difference between parameters vs arguments

# Control Flow and Array

#### 1. Define a function that accepts a sentence string and two words as args. The function should return a boolean indicating if the sentence includes either word
#### 2. Identify a pair of mutaully exclusive conditions
#### 3. Given a for loop, transite it into a while loop, and vice versa
#### 4. Write a function that iterates through a provided string argument
#### 5. Given a description of pig latin, write a function that takes in a string argument and utilizes String's `slice()` method to translate the string into pig latin
#### 6. Write a function that takes in an array of words and a string as arguments and returns a boolean indiciating whether the string is located inside of the array. The function must use Array's `indexOf()` method
#### 7. Define that an array literal is an ordered list of values defined by using bracket and individual valyes are read by indexing

# Intermediate Functions

#### 1. Identify that strings are immutable and arrays are mutable
#### 2. Define a function using both function declaration and function expression syntax
#### 3. Utilize `Array.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, and `.unshift()` to mutate an array
#### 4. List the arguments that can be used with `Array.splice()`
#### 5. Write a function that sums up elements of an array, given an array of numbers as an argument
#### 6. Define a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the primes
#### 7. Define a function that takes in a 2D array of numbers and returns the total sum of all elements in the array
#### 8. Define a function that takes in an array of elements and returns a 2D array where the subarrays represent unique pairs of elements
#### 9. Define a function that takes in an array of numbers as an argument and returns the smallest value in the array; if the array is empty, return `null`
